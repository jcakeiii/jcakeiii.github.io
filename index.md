## About Me

My name is Thu but I also go by Jackie. I am a junior at DePauw University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. I will be graduating in December 2024. My DREU experience is with my mentor Dr. Kate Ringland at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I have wanted to go to California for a long time so it's a great experience getting to spend a summer here!

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Kate Ringland, an Assistant Professor in the Computational Media department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her research interests include studying and designing playful and community-oriented technology for people with disabilities. She leads the [Misfit Lab](https://www.misfit-lab.com/) at the university, which I'm glad to be a part of this summer.

## About My Project

The project I'm working on is Archive by Army, a community-specific platform for generating and providing alt text for images and gifs for content relevant to the community. This is a community-driven platform in that all the content, alt text, tags, etc. are provided by community members.
