Making good progress with Django. Some other team members and I are continuing with other tasks such as designing the web interface. We had our first web design meeting this week and discussed the current progress, as well as brainstorming new ideas for the website. I continued with literature reviews and I'm also starting to brainstorm what I want to be on the final report, since this is a part of a larger project and not a standalone research.
