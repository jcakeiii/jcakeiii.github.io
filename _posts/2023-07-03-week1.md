title: Week 1

During the first week, I met with my mentor to discuss the project I will be working on and my tasks for the week. I met with other team members who are working on the project to discuss the current status of the project, as well as get acquainted with the project. It has been running for a while, so there is a lot to catch up on. Because the project uses some programming languages and technologies I haven't had much experience in such as Python and Django, I spent the rest of the week learning them. I also spent some time reading HCI research papers, to get acquainted with the work of the lab and the project I'm working on.
