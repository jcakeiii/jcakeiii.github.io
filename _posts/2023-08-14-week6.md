We had another web design meeting this week. We decided to start working on the frontend first while waiting for the AWS to get set up. I started learning Bootstrap to use it for the project as it's in the tech stack already. I also spent time reviewing and practicing HTML and CSS, since I haven't had much chance to actually use them before, as well as learning new JavaScript concepts for the frontend.
