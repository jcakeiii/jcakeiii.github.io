title: Week 8
---
It was a very busy week for me. I made travel arrangements with DREU way before I knew I had to start my research late, so I still had to fly back to my university during my research. Packing was a lot of work! I went back to my university to grab the rest of my stuff before I start my study abroad program on the 30th. During this week, I finished up my final report and wrapped up some of my work too, and met with my advisor for the last time. It has been a really great experience! I really enjoyed working on my research and discovered a lot about the field and about myself too. I'm very thankful for DREU for granting me this opportunity and my mentor who has been very supportive of me this summer.
