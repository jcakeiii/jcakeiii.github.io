Making good progress with Django. Right now, the project is kind of at a standstill because we are figuring out how to deploy the web on AWS. However, some other team members and I are continuing with other tasks such as designing the web interface. I'm starting to brainstorm what I want to be on the final report, since this is a part of a larger project and not a standalone research.
